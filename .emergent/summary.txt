The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive landing page for StataBots, iterating through multiple user requests. Initial work focused on creating a modern, conversion-optimized frontend with mock data for two main bots, adhering to strict design guidelines. The engineer then integrated a backend to handle a contact form and Telegram notifications, requesting the user for API keys. Subsequent iterations involved extensive content and layout adjustments, including adding new services, reordering sections, updating footer links, and integrating a provided YCLIENTS JavaScript code snippet. Critical design refinements included mobile optimization, ROI calculator implementation, animated backgrounds, and numerous text corrections, all validated with frontend screenshots. The last interaction highlighted pending design fixes for the ROI calculator and text replacements.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a modern, conversion-optimized landing page for StataBots, showcasing two products: Missed Calls Bot and Employee Performance Bot, both with a 3-day free trial. The design should feature a blue color scheme, layered elements, glass-morphism effects, and strong CTAs. Later, the user expanded requirements to include:
1. A Contact Us form with Telegram notifications for admin.
2. Mobile optimization (responsiveness, larger buttons, readability).
3. Technical support buttons (Telegram: @StatabotsM, WhatsApp: +79939233646).
4. An interactive ROI calculator for the Missed Calls Bot (full width, no preset buttons, formula update).
5. Visual enhancements: scroll animations, infographics, animated icons, subtle background animations.
6. Integration of a custom YCLIENTS JavaScript code snippet for lead tracking.
7. Addition of two new bot services: Daily Cash Report Bot and Employee Payroll Bot, plus a Custom Development service.
8. Reorganization of services into categorized tabs (YCLIENTS Bots, Audit, Development) and specific section ordering (Bots -> Trial Period -> Audit).
9. Various text updates across the site, including hero section, button labels (e.g., Подключить), footer, and service descriptions (Например instead of Что решает:).
10. Logo updates and removal of Made with Emergent branding.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's latest feedback concerning design and textual improvements.
The primary focus was on:
1.  **ROI Calculator Redesign**: The user explicitly requested the ROI calculator () to be full-width, without any white margins, making it a cohesive part of the site's background. They also requested the removal of the text explaining the calculation basis (Расчет основан на: стоимости решения 2 000₽/мес и эффективности 70% предотвращения потерь).
2.  **Text Replacement**: The user asked to change the phrase Что решает: to Например across all service descriptions ().

The AI engineer acknowledged these tasks and confirmed they would address the ROI calculator's design and the text replacement in service components. The last action in the trajectory was an edit to  and  to implement these changes. The system's response was Edit was successful for both, but the user immediately followed up by reiterating the ROI calculator's full-width requirement and removal of text, indicating it might not have been fully resolved to their satisfaction in the previous step.

<optional_next_step>
Re-verify and ensure the ROI calculator is full-width with no side margins, and remove the calculation basis text from it.
